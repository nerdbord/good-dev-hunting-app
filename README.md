### Project Documentation

**Branch Management and Merge:**

- Each task should have its own branch in the Git repository. The branch name should be descriptive and reflect the task's topic.
- Before merging into the main branch (main), at least three (3) approvals from other team members are required.

**Branch and Commit Naming:**

We follow the convention specified in: [Link](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/")
For example: 'feat/branch-name', 'fix: commit name'

**Communication and Code Review:**

- We actively monitor the Discord channel, where all pull requests (PRs) are automatically posted.
- We perform code reviews on GitHub. You can refer to the following tutorials: [link1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSnbOtw4izI) [link2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSsUO_OP-f8)
- We include helpful comments in the code for the rest of the team.

**Folder Structure:**

- Each component should reside in its own folder within the main "components" folder.
- The folder name should correspond to the component's name. For example: /components/Header.
- Place component-related files inside the component folder, such as Header.tsx, Header.module.scss.

**Styling:**

-We use SASS.  
-For each component, create a CSS file named ComponentName.module.scss.

**Class Naming:**

- All classes and component names should be written in camelCase. For example: headerButton
- Avoid using underscores, hyphens, or other special characters in class and component names.
- Use names that clearly describe the functionality and purpose of the element.

**Dynamic CSS Classes:**

For dynamic CSS classes, we recommend using the classnames/bind library. You can install it by running: 'npm install classnames'.
Once installed, you can use the library as follows:

```
import classNames from 'classnames/bind';
const cx = classNames.bind(styles);
const [active, setActive] = useState(false);

const getDynamicHeaderClasses = cx({
[styles.headerWrapper]: true,
[styles.headerisActive]: active === true,
[styles.headerNotActive]: !active,
});

return (

  <div className={getDynamicHeaderClasses}>Header</div>
)
```

You can also explore the usage of classnames/bind in our native Nerdux project:

**Backend Structure:**

We structure the backend logic as follows:

```
backend/[domainName]/[domainName.service.ts] - for storing business logic
backend/[domainName]/[domainName.serializer.ts] - for serializers that map data from database to DTOs
backend/[domainName]/[domainName.types.ts] - for storing DTOs
```
