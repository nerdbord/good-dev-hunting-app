### Project Documentation

Branch Management and Merge:

-Each task should have its own branch in the Git repository. The branch name should be descriptive and reflect the task's topic.
-Before merging into the main branch (main), at least three (3) approvals from other team members are required.


Branch and Commit Naming:

We follow the convention specified in: <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/">[Link]</a>
For example: 'feat/branch-name', 'fix: commit name'


Communication and Code Review:

-We actively monitor the Discord channel, where all pull requests (PRs) are automatically posted.
-We perform code reviews on GitHub. You can refer to the following tutorials: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSnbOtw4izI">[link1]</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSsUO_OP-f8">[link2].</a>
-We include helpful comments in the code for the rest of the team.


Folder Structure:

-Each component should reside in its own folder within the main "components" folder.
-The folder name should correspond to the component's name. For example: /components/Header.
-Place component-related files inside the component folder, such as Header.tsx, Header.module.css.


Styling:

-We use SASS.
-For each component, create a CSS file named ComponentName.module.scss.


Class Naming:

-All classes and component names should be written in camelCase. For example: headerButton
-Avoid using underscores, hyphens, or other special characters in class and component names.
-Use names that clearly describe the functionality and purpose of the element.


Dynamic CSS Classes:

For dynamic CSS classes, we recommend using the classnames/bind library. You can install it by running: 'npm install classnames'.
Once installed, you can use the library as follows:
(The first person needing dynamic classes should install it)

/* `import classNames from 'classnames/bind';
const cx = classNames.bind(styles);
const [active, setActive] = useState(false);

const getDynamicHeaderClasses = cx({
[styles.headerWrapper]: true,
[styles.headerisActive]: active === true,
[styles.headerNotActive]: !active,
});

return (

  <div className={getDynamicHeaderClasses}>Header</div>
)` */
